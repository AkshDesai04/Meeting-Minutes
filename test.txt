0:0:0.0 --> 0:0:0.250
Rajasekaran N
Hmm.
0:0:4.90 --> 0:0:4.980
Umesh Sonawane
How we can give you the intelligence to you to make some decisions in terms of if it is a visualization, transports, et cetera.
0:0:8.840 --> 0:0:9.20
Rajasekaran N
So.
0:0:5.800 --> 0:0:12.850
Umesh Sonawane
So I would request you think through this everyone from your team will you can take five, five minutes and you just list down.
0:0:13.40 --> 0:0:14.550
Umesh Sonawane
These are the things we want to do.
0:0:15.410 --> 0:0:15.590
Rajasekaran N
So.
0:0:14.940 --> 0:0:20.70
Umesh Sonawane
Probably later on we will sort, we will understand the priorities and etcetera.
0:0:20.160 --> 0:0:21.200
Umesh Sonawane
But let's start with this.
0:0:21.960 --> 0:0:22.380
Rajasekaran N
Sure, sure.
0:0:23.530 --> 0:0:23.810
Umesh Sonawane
OK.
0:0:23.450 --> 0:0:26.490
Rajasekaran N
But first of all, umm, thanks for that dinner.
0:0:26.500 --> 0:0:37.820
Rajasekaran N
I'll kick off the data and this itself shows how IT can be a good enabler for businesses because the first time we were always begined IT but first time.
0:0:38.320 --> 0:0:40.320
Rajasekaran N
Maybe it's a good coincidence data also, right?
0:1:13.890 --> 0:1:14.70
Umesh Sonawane
Better.
0:0:43.700 --> 0:1:19.900
Rajasekaran N
Missed by trying to dismiss use and realities, so this again reinforces every but now and then you know S are always say that they are always saying we should be one of the leading company in the IT space on the we probably say compared to other chemical company we have our own it like that we used to say and many products what we have given to the market also very well received and we will by knows Atul Setu is 1 because Dilkhush people but by everybody was helping us that one man I think Manisha man everybody.
0:1:20.10 --> 0:1:25.300
Rajasekaran N
Was that and it is a very innocuous the yeah not tool.
0:1:25.670 --> 0:1:29.650
Rajasekaran N
And one of the envying to the industry and people take as an example.
0:1:32.350 --> 0:1:35.310
Rajasekaran N
Ohh, I'd complete the meeting this.
0:1:37.390 --> 0:1:39.370
Rajasekaran N
You same same.
0:1:41.230 --> 0:1:46.240
Rajasekaran N
So umm that like that one tool has come now very good.
0:1:46.310 --> 0:1:53.720
Rajasekaran N
So and the other one is a honeycomb that is also I think you know it knows developed and for the MDO management.
0:1:54.430 --> 0:1:55.780
Rajasekaran N
So that is going fine.
0:1:55.830 --> 0:1:57.20
Rajasekaran N
Little bit of fine tuning.
0:1:57.30 --> 0:1:59.40
Rajasekaran N
You know, we need to make welcome again, right.
0:2:0.210 --> 0:2:0.500
Umesh Sonawane
The.
0:1:59.610 --> 0:2:6.290
Rajasekaran N
And when I talked about plan visits and Mangesh by arrived, when you think of a Devil, devil has come.
0:2:5.390 --> 0:2:7.80
Umesh Sonawane
Of put them in.
0:2:7.630 --> 0:2:9.110
Rajasekaran N
Don't get the Angel.
0:2:9.630 --> 0:2:11.300
Rajasekaran N
Devil is not the right example.
0:2:12.70 --> 0:2:12.330
Umesh Sonawane
Derek.
0:2:11.370 --> 0:2:12.930
Rajasekaran N
OK, so the one.
0:2:15.330 --> 0:2:18.0
Rajasekaran N
One thing work in progress is planned size.
0:2:18.330 --> 0:2:20.280
Rajasekaran N
So with Mangesh, why is the right person?
0:2:20.620 --> 0:2:55.490
Rajasekaran N
He was leading that activity, demand planning tool, but though that is not announced but definitely you know it was a collaborative, I don't know ID: one which was long waited and I understand people Retail successfully implemented and started using and we had some tips Mangesh by we talk about that on plan research what is the expectation so Mangesh by what I was saying this is a good initiative that IT team is coming proactively and asking businesses hey how I can be enabled for you and how I can make your business you know further profitable and group.
0:2:55.640 --> 0:2:56.230
Rajasekaran N
Speeding growth.
0:2:56.340 --> 0:3:5.290
Rajasekaran N
So that's what I was very happy for them and of course till that time also whenever we were going behind, of course Dilkhush can vouch for it because.
0:3:7.90 --> 0:3:9.540
Rajasekaran N
Our business is no timely.
0:3:9.550 --> 0:3:16.280
Rajasekaran N
You know, we need to respond back because we are handling farmers, you know, crop on disk, cannot wait for our IT team or whatever.
0:3:16.470 --> 0:3:23.680
Rajasekaran N
So whenever any new term or anything any no in the IT GST is not picking up.
0:3:23.690 --> 0:3:33.870
Rajasekaran N
So always they could, you know, moves to the IT office and we we used to get a very good response time from IT team despite their workload and priorities distance.
0:3:32.440 --> 0:3:35.140
Umesh Sonawane
As a as a it did OK.
0:3:35.950 --> 0:3:36.580
Rajasekaran N
So thanks for that.
0:3:38.690 --> 0:3:40.600
Umesh Sonawane
Thank you it.
0:3:38.430 --> 0:3:42.440
Rajasekaran N
OK, so thanks for coming from there.
0:3:44.360 --> 0:3:44.640
Umesh Sonawane
But.
0:3:42.690 --> 0:3:48.800
Rajasekaran N
Business site Umeshbhai was asking how was the journey so conceding Lee they closed the.
0:3:46.700 --> 0:3:50.230
Umesh Sonawane
Yep, you can tell one Patel. But.
0:3:52.220 --> 0:3:53.370
Umesh Sonawane
Focus, focus, focus.
0:3:54.500 --> 0:3:54.830
Umesh Sonawane
That's not.
0:3:57.430 --> 0:3:57.730
Umesh Sonawane
OK.
0:3:59.680 --> 0:4:0.230
Umesh Sonawane
Uh, yes.
0:3:59.390 --> 0:4:2.680
Rajasekaran N
And this so the queen savingly.
0:4:3.510 --> 0:4:16.180
Rajasekaran N
It was a good no news that you would have seen enough in the mails that first time CP retail maybe after, you know recent gap then we are making maybe the positive close to five crore.
0:4:16.490 --> 0:4:18.740
Rajasekaran N
What I understand here last year was minus 8 crore.
0:4:19.800 --> 0:4:20.70
Umesh Sonawane
No.
0:4:20.80 --> 0:4:20.780
Umesh Sonawane
Good, good, very good.
0:4:19.290 --> 0:4:22.250
Rajasekaran N
So when when we took over as thanks for that.
0:4:22.260 --> 0:4:22.610
Rajasekaran N
Yeah.
0:4:22.690 --> 0:4:23.270
Rajasekaran N
Thanks for that.
0:4:23.580 --> 0:4:36.630
Rajasekaran N
When we started our journey of Naya Abdul in CP Retail, we had a terminology of Maya Atul from 2019 onwards because earlier we were not having a directionally uh growth, no direction.
0:4:36.640 --> 0:4:37.410
Rajasekaran N
We were not having.
0:4:37.420 --> 0:4:40.180
Rajasekaran N
It was always absent down since it's inception.
0:4:40.990 --> 0:4:44.620
Rajasekaran N
Maybe Dilkhush can mention it is around 2014 or so.
0:4:45.70 --> 0:4:50.20
Rajasekaran N
We started over now journey, but it was always ups and down ranging from 80 to 120 crore.
0:4:50.590 --> 0:4:54.160
Rajasekaran N
But now in 918 nineteen it was around 88 crore.
0:4:54.220 --> 0:4:56.940
Rajasekaran N
Now we have crossed 200 crore every year.
0:4:56.950 --> 0:5:3.250
Rajasekaran N
We were on a growth path and a profitably also this year onwards we will be making profit this year means last financial year.
0:5:4.10 --> 0:5:8.280
Rajasekaran N
So over and also we got our own patented product called Sindica.
0:5:8.560 --> 0:5:15.980
Rajasekaran N
Till that time we were using only our manufacturing that chemistry strength of participating in the generic product which others also ask.
0:5:15.990 --> 0:5:22.530
Rajasekaran N
There was no specialization, but for our chemistry of, you know, manufacturing sites or whatever.
0:5:23.470 --> 0:5:26.540
Rajasekaran N
But now we'll be having our unique patented product marketing team.
0:5:26.550 --> 0:5:28.120
Rajasekaran N
Province are also you guys will be meeting.
0:5:28.650 --> 0:5:39.880
Rajasekaran N
So he's a grip, you know, on a constant space, he's bringing new active ingredients and the specialized product so that we can be taken as a serious player in the Indian market, OK and.
0:5:39.620 --> 0:5:39.890
Umesh Sonawane
How?
0:5:39.900 --> 0:5:40.890
Umesh Sonawane
How is it patents?
0:5:40.900 --> 0:5:41.300
Umesh Sonawane
Do you have?
0:5:42.480 --> 0:5:43.790
Umesh Sonawane
Of just one picture.
0:5:42.750 --> 0:5:45.620
Rajasekaran N
So maybe 3-4?
0:5:47.480 --> 0:5:47.720
Umesh Sonawane
OK.
0:5:45.730 --> 0:5:53.100
Rajasekaran N
Maybe maybe having maybe province or will give you exact number, but the 3-4 product but only one product so far is launched last year they called sindica.
0:5:53.450 --> 0:5:55.100
Rajasekaran N
That is the first patented product.
0:5:55.310 --> 0:5:57.960
Rajasekaran N
No, we just come to the market and it is accepted very well.
0:5:58.450 --> 0:6:25.820
Rajasekaran N
So that is also one of the boost that you know, despite last year was a very bad year because of the external factors and our business is you will see multiple times will talk about Bhagwan in our business, other business may not talk too much of God but here suddenly rain came server game OK I am based is not come back one did not send a note timely you know whether is needed for the disease to set in or insect to come.
0:6:26.390 --> 0:6:33.820
Rajasekaran N
So even one Barrish will take all the opportunity out, which may not be the case for any other businesses or businesses.
0:6:33.830 --> 0:6:41.780
Rajasekaran N
More stable and more FMCG won't intended other build ticals, but CP is you know in the influence of God always.
0:6:41.790 --> 0:6:55.760
Rajasekaran N
So that's what now we also little bit always demand the agility and speed which of any call comes from people by people by will get SP goes up because these guys will not wait see in the solution immediately because no of the external factors.
0:6:56.710 --> 0:6:57.670
Umesh Sonawane
Hey, Lisa.
0:6:55.810 --> 0:6:58.460
Rajasekaran N
OK, so luckily they're in the right direction.
0:6:58.830 --> 0:7:5.660
Rajasekaran N
And umeshbhai and data and the team and very special thanks to censor.
0:7:5.670 --> 0:7:15.930
Rajasekaran N
And Sunil is Jay buyer Ajay Mai, who always believe that you know, uh when others were saying, you know, a bulk is our core or B2B is our core.
0:7:15.940 --> 0:7:20.750
Rajasekaran N
But B2C also, he was not leaving that no hope on us.
0:7:21.260 --> 0:7:33.630
Rajasekaran N
So because the main reason is the valuation, what I understand from him that the every bottle of our CP retail business is like visiting card to a farming community.
0:7:33.980 --> 0:7:36.670
Rajasekaran N
So they will come to know about Atul through our bottles.
0:7:36.840 --> 0:7:43.250
Rajasekaran N
Abdul, our products imagine millions of farmers in India and everybody knows Atul, Atul, Atul, the PE multiples.
0:7:44.510 --> 0:7:44.770
Umesh Sonawane
OK.
0:7:43.500 --> 0:7:45.320
Rajasekaran N
The value will go up, though.
0:7:45.360 --> 0:7:56.150
Rajasekaran N
We're constantly making the negative PBT, but strongly he was believing because if you see ideally now the CP bulk to retail, it's a transfer price.
0:7:57.30 --> 0:8:2.620
Rajasekaran N
So it is not the real loss, but as a unique may be losing you know for the so so many years.
0:8:2.690 --> 0:8:6.120
Rajasekaran N
But overall, if you see, we were making money because of the transfer price.
0:8:6.190 --> 0:8:9.460
Rajasekaran N
We book money in the bulk and then transferred to retail.
0:8:10.610 --> 0:8:10.940
Umesh Sonawane
But it.
0:8:9.570 --> 0:8:16.400
Rajasekaran N
So that's what is interest is the overall we are making money at the same time it is like a visiting card to the forming community.
0:8:16.410 --> 0:8:17.920
Rajasekaran N
So that Atul valuation will go up.
0:8:18.450 --> 0:8:30.10
Rajasekaran N
So that's what we strongly believing and he's continuously supporting and telling us guys go aggressive now and next this year we are planning weekly having crossed 2 not 2 is what they are touching.
0:8:30.20 --> 0:8:38.50
Rajasekaran N
This last year, with the PBT positive of five crore and next year, it will be, I think 8,00,00,000 and 265 crore on the top line.
0:8:38.540 --> 0:8:42.590
Rajasekaran N
So every year we thought of crossing the milestone Mark 250, then 300.
0:8:42.780 --> 0:8:44.900
Rajasekaran N
So how soon we are achieving 500 crores?
0:8:44.910 --> 0:8:58.780
Rajasekaran N
What the journey we started four years back and we had a clear strategy in one page, which we always had in every strategy meeting there, how this home autumn home we constructed, how to take this company from 88 nothing 500 crore.
0:8:58.790 --> 0:9:3.960
Rajasekaran N
No, we keep on updating the strategy and we keep showing who are the people began every year.
0:9:4.150 --> 0:9:9.620
Rajasekaran N
The team photo also we keep in our strategy meeting who delivered this 200 crore who we delivered 175 crore.
0:9:9.710 --> 0:9:15.590
Rajasekaran N
So the curiosity increases, so we are in a fast growth journey and profitably in the future.
0:9:16.340 --> 0:9:17.570
Rajasekaran N
So the support required.
0:9:20.540 --> 0:9:21.820
Rajasekaran N
Click yeah.
0:9:21.830 --> 0:9:22.150
Rajasekaran N
Yeah, please.
0:9:17.630 --> 0:9:33.220
Umesh Sonawane
I I have one curiosity in my mind if you allow so see we thought we thought Advent of your ecommerce OK now now that decision making is more words the more in the hand of the consumers.
0:9:33.470 --> 0:9:35.740
Rajasekaran N
Prince correct. Hmm.
0:9:45.680 --> 0:9:45.930
Rajasekaran N
Hmm.
0:9:33.810 --> 0:9:47.20
Umesh Sonawane
OK, in most of the cases, so is crop protection business because of maybe the the farmers are not knowledgeable enough or they do not know exactly.
0:9:47.290 --> 0:9:51.830
Umesh Sonawane
There are maybe some middle some middle parties are playing a good roles.
0:9:52.480 --> 0:9:52.670
Rajasekaran N
Sure.
0:9:52.930 --> 0:10:2.140
Umesh Sonawane
OK, so how how you are thinking that you can really reach to your end customers in a better way and all those things.
0:10:5.450 --> 0:10:5.650
Rajasekaran N
So.
0:10:2.220 --> 0:10:7.400
Umesh Sonawane
You I would really like to get some insights from you and see. Yep.
0:10:8.130 --> 0:10:8.380
Rajasekaran N
Sweet.
0:10:8.390 --> 0:10:18.340
Rajasekaran N
Last or not most, most a decade, there's no ecommerce is picking up and many companies were trying into this ad space.
0:10:27.400 --> 0:10:27.530
Umesh Sonawane
Yes.
0:10:34.530 --> 0:10:34.670
Umesh Sonawane
But.
0:10:18.490 --> 0:10:36.420
Rajasekaran N
But the challenges where many because it is not only selling a product like FMCG, it is like services or more important, what is the stage of the crop, whether water level is there in the field, how many acres can be covered with that one bottle because these are all related project.
0:10:36.490 --> 0:10:39.460
Rajasekaran N
Anything, even something is left out at home.
0:10:39.550 --> 0:10:44.810
Rajasekaran N
If there is a, you know, fight in the former family happens the next day, the lady drinks and dies, for example.
0:10:45.610 --> 0:10:46.320
Umesh Sonawane
Yes, yes.
0:10:45.520 --> 0:10:48.600
Rajasekaran N
So that kind of very dangerous.
0:10:48.610 --> 0:10:53.250
Rajasekaran N
And tomorrow the Decembers will be behind bars for instigating this ad, for example.
0:10:54.60 --> 0:10:57.880
Rajasekaran N
So this is not OK if you buy paste or you know TV, this may not happen.
0:10:58.640 --> 0:11:0.690
Rajasekaran N
So the company will send the installation.
0:11:0.700 --> 0:11:2.670
Rajasekaran N
Second important problem is logistics.
0:11:3.530 --> 0:11:10.50
Rajasekaran N
Because for all the E commerce platform, the moment you put a PIN code you IT will say whether you're services are there or not.
0:11:10.120 --> 0:11:13.290
Rajasekaran N
Here the PIN code compared to Amazon or Flipkart.
0:11:13.300 --> 0:11:18.230
Rajasekaran N
The PIN codes are near the city in the city, but here the PIN codes are everywhere.
0:11:19.70 --> 0:11:19.390
Umesh Sonawane
But it.
0:11:18.560 --> 0:11:22.40
Rajasekaran N
Entire India cascade to and Gujarat to Guwahati.
0:11:22.880 --> 0:11:23.80
Umesh Sonawane
OK.
0:11:22.210 --> 0:11:24.960
Rajasekaran N
So that kind of a everywhere they're spreading.
0:11:25.0 --> 0:11:26.560
Rajasekaran N
So logistic is killing them.
0:11:26.770 --> 0:11:28.300
Rajasekaran N
Many companies are still trying.
0:11:28.310 --> 0:11:31.660
Rajasekaran N
I'm not saying it will not be successful, but it will take a lot of time.
0:11:31.790 --> 0:11:34.770
Rajasekaran N
Agro Star is 1 company many, many companies.
0:11:35.60 --> 0:11:37.390
Rajasekaran N
They're trying and it is highly regulated.
0:11:37.400 --> 0:11:46.570
Rajasekaran N
You need to have a selling permission and place and if anything happens to the former then the compensation you know, government machineries are very active.
0:11:47.110 --> 0:11:48.900
Rajasekaran N
So they will not leave any platform.
0:11:49.190 --> 0:11:49.800
Rajasekaran N
So.
0:11:58.610 --> 0:11:58.810
Umesh Sonawane
Yeah.
0:11:49.870 --> 0:12:0.840
Rajasekaran N
So that's what it's kind of a personal guarantee that individual retailer were sitting because these retailers are nothing but the farmer or the farmers relating and also they don't crop to crop.
0:12:1.790 --> 0:12:15.540
Rajasekaran N
I'm gonna buy a TV or a fridge on a loan, but farmer buys all the product on the loan, hoping that his harvest will come and he will sell the produce which is Paddy or cotton or whatever to apple or whatever and give the money back to the retailer.
0:12:16.340 --> 0:12:24.150
Rajasekaran N
This credit facility ecommerce cannot give though they are saying buy now pay later and all but it is lot of documentation and all this stuff.
0:12:24.420 --> 0:12:30.470
Rajasekaran N
So it will take a lot of time, but I'm not saying it is not there that it is there but very miniscule scale.
0:12:31.290 --> 0:12:31.680
Rajasekaran N
Somebody.
0:12:32.300 --> 0:12:32.500
Umesh Sonawane
There's.
0:12:31.690 --> 0:12:34.820
Rajasekaran N
Not even a percentage I can for one person off a percent.
0:12:34.830 --> 0:12:35.340
Rajasekaran N
Kind of a.
0:12:42.620 --> 0:12:42.790
Umesh Sonawane
OK.
0:12:35.390 --> 0:12:44.600
Rajasekaran N
It's a 25,000 crore industry, but many people are now really struggling who got into ecommerce and they closed also many, many big giant PC and all they tried.
0:12:44.870 --> 0:12:52.800
Rajasekaran N
ITC is a big giant, so each of all they tried but gone now only across our Pune based company will be designed there.
0:12:52.810 --> 0:12:56.270
Rajasekaran N
No presence there otherwise this logistic is killing them.
0:12:59.270 --> 0:12:59.510
Umesh Sonawane
Sure.
0:12:56.380 --> 0:13:1.350
Rajasekaran N
It's a continuously under loss to reach that one bottle, so that remote location.
0:13:1.820 --> 0:13:3.610
Rajasekaran N
So it's not that practically.
0:13:3.290 --> 0:13:3.900
Umesh Sonawane
Yeah, yeah, true.
0:13:5.490 --> 0:13:8.330
Rajasekaran N
OK, then right, so.
0:13:15.620 --> 0:13:15.820
Umesh Sonawane
Yeah.
0:13:10.140 --> 0:13:17.400
Rajasekaran N
To no any question on the business perspective, umeshbhai or anyone in the right anuja.
0:13:19.470 --> 0:13:21.460
Umesh Sonawane
So so.
0:13:21.470 --> 0:13:38.590
Umesh Sonawane
But I just now anything you would like like, you know, based on your personal experience with the competitors or your personal in your opinion per se, do you feel that we should have some automated solution in place you would like to give some thoughts on that?
0:13:39.170 --> 0:13:51.160
Rajasekaran N
Yes, yes, yes, one is, if you ask me the priority one is the whatever the product we launched some suggestions we made for example in Atul Setu.
0:13:51.540 --> 0:14:2.360
Rajasekaran N
Uh, the credit balance is not visible to the customers and in mobsales that is one of the IT tool which we have given the tablets to the sales team.
0:14:3.210 --> 0:14:34.50
Rajasekaran N
There a lot of improvements we were suggesting, but unfortunately we were also not very pushy to IT team because they're workload is very high and it will go into the maybe 10th or 11th priority because they were the big big, you know, giant called Atul Connect or CRM the boss hijacking the you know IT team that time so far now that CRM is in good shape what I understand and now that we have the time and the full team I'm happy to see you know many people sitting in the starting from the lead no I'm very.
0:14:34.170 --> 0:15:7.520
Rajasekaran N
Happy to see earlier it was missing now that the data is there and Umesh gym team is very you know full fledged I think the Dilkhush can put us back what all our you know work in progress pending plus the plan Visage Update managed by can give but maybe my 2-3 point request is 1 but to make the existing tools robust by you know plugging those gaps which is you know evidently you know visible so that the tool will be perfect #1 because I'm up sales is one I said they're the data is not full proof.
0:15:8.80 --> 0:15:12.50
Rajasekaran N
And in Abdul Setu, the credit balance option that you know Dilkhush cannot give it.
0:15:12.60 --> 0:15:14.430
Rajasekaran N
Well, the third one is the plan.
0:15:14.440 --> 0:15:17.890
Rajasekaran N
Research perfection because still we are a work in progress.
0:15:17.900 --> 0:15:22.130
Rajasekaran N
Though Mangesh Dr will brief then the 4th one.
0:15:22.500 --> 0:15:26.240
Rajasekaran N
Is there a honeycomb that they're also some challenges?
0:15:26.250 --> 0:15:34.520
Rajasekaran N
Are there off and I'm not remembering, but always you know your team is available for that and we will keep on some time.
0:15:34.730 --> 0:15:44.570
Rajasekaran N
Even you know many times when they're trying to enter the password issue, even the portico I'm not, which you know, very clear portico is working smooth enough.
0:15:44.610 --> 0:15:56.370
Rajasekaran N
Not an issue, but this Atul Setu password issues used to happen unicomb password issue plus data challenges that used to happen that so we will keep that list.
0:15:56.380 --> 0:16:0.10
Rajasekaran N
You know the task list ready, then the second.
0:16:0.20 --> 0:16:12.850
Rajasekaran N
Once we make the existing tool robust, then 2-3 IT tools we badly need, which Dilkhush will articulate the pricing tool, which industry or you know thoroughly using.
0:16:13.440 --> 0:16:17.170
Rajasekaran N
It's a commercial tool, a simple app for a salesperson today.
0:16:17.180 --> 0:16:26.630
Rajasekaran N
You know, a lot of time is taken away if some order comes to find out the value of the order to guide the customer to send the payments and everything.
0:16:27.40 --> 0:16:32.460
Rajasekaran N
So he's struggling today, so if you can give a the simple tool, umm, I don't.
0:16:32.470 --> 0:16:38.170
Rajasekaran N
I'm not sure whether you're scope will allow to travel in the marketplace, or at least in Gujarat, since you're all in.
0:16:38.260 --> 0:17:10.820
Rajasekaran N
Well said, I can tune Surat maybe any any one interested so that you will understand how our trade operates in and around Surat even whilst out also is a good man who market we have couple customer just you come out of the gate we have our own distribution rate you can visit get a filler how this industry operates and what kind of IT tool competition is using was like this placing tool or whatever so that is badly needed this year in fact they'll push has taken in the keyboard then we can you know maybe Santosh.
0:17:10.420 --> 0:17:13.450
Umesh Sonawane
So I I I sorry, I will interrupted.
0:17:14.20 --> 0:17:14.220
Rajasekaran N
Please.
0:17:13.790 --> 0:17:14.340
Umesh Sonawane
So they could.
0:17:21.90 --> 0:17:21.300
Rajasekaran N
No.
0:17:21.310 --> 0:17:21.640
Rajasekaran N
So so.
0:17:14.350 --> 0:17:22.900
Umesh Sonawane
Can you take us to any of this and just show us that was that the what are the tools they are using and everything so please pick that as a part.
0:17:22.910 --> 0:17:24.670
Umesh Sonawane
So we would like to participate.
0:17:25.30 --> 0:17:29.50
Umesh Sonawane
We would like to understand what are those and we'll try to help you out, OK.
0:17:27.170 --> 0:17:35.790
Rajasekaran N
Yeah, maybe in Thailand meeting since it's a kickoff meeting, so we can the next meeting Dilkhush can come prepared.
0:17:35.800 --> 0:17:41.650
Rajasekaran N
We have a IT team has given a very good dinner presentations how the PDF, how it works and all those stuff.
0:17:41.900 --> 0:17:44.50
Rajasekaran N
But maybe Dilkhush will be ready every tool.
0:17:44.120 --> 0:17:45.240
Rajasekaran N
What is our pain point?
0:17:45.280 --> 0:17:51.170
Rajasekaran N
These are all minor because it is working smooth but only thing to make it 100% perfect.
0:17:57.140 --> 0:17:57.510
Umesh Sonawane
No, no.
0:17:51.180 --> 0:17:57.560
Rajasekaran N
Saying that successful tool, but these minor things every time because we are having a town hall meeting on next Monday.
0:18:0.360 --> 0:18:0.540
Rajasekaran N
So.
0:17:57.520 --> 0:18:1.390
Umesh Sonawane
So that I'm no, no, that I got it that I got it registered correctly.
0:18:1.400 --> 0:18:2.170
Umesh Sonawane
So that will get.
0:18:3.870 --> 0:18:4.120
Rajasekaran N
Stop.
0:18:2.180 --> 0:18:9.850
Umesh Sonawane
I'm not asking about that, I'm asking that what tools you do not have, but others are having in your competition.
0:18:10.260 --> 0:18:13.200
Umesh Sonawane
If we can see those and see how we can help you.
0:18:8.960 --> 0:18:14.320
Rajasekaran N
Ah, so OK, perfect.
0:18:14.330 --> 0:18:16.500
Rajasekaran N
Perfect that that one is the pricing tool.
0:18:17.710 --> 0:18:17.940
Umesh Sonawane
Correct.
0:18:16.650 --> 0:18:26.420
Rajasekaran N
I'm saying earlier the one big mist was there travel claim tool which has come now in my in my earlier company also I was using a tool called Conquer.
0:18:26.730 --> 0:18:29.890
Rajasekaran N
Now we are having this hey, so that is fixed now.
0:18:28.50 --> 0:18:30.830
Umesh Sonawane
It's a I'm happy, yeah.
0:18:30.890 --> 0:18:32.540
Rajasekaran N
I've been so that is fixed now.
0:18:32.990 --> 0:18:35.880
Rajasekaran N
Generally, these are the two three major tool we were missing.
0:18:36.410 --> 0:18:39.260
Rajasekaran N
So one is this and one is a former app.
0:18:39.530 --> 0:18:44.260
Rajasekaran N
Generally all company they have an app for former, including the sale, purchase, sale.
0:18:49.290 --> 0:18:49.570
Umesh Sonawane
Correct.
0:18:44.410 --> 0:18:50.80
Rajasekaran N
But that is not in my priority list because of the whatever the challenges I said, no, it will be applicable to us also.
0:18:50.390 --> 0:18:53.220
Rajasekaran N
We will do it because we are small and beautiful company.
0:18:53.490 --> 0:18:56.500
Rajasekaran N
We are not a big and ugly or we are not big and beautiful right now.
0:18:56.510 --> 0:18:59.580
Rajasekaran N
We are just at 200 crore company in it, 20,000 crore market.
0:18:59.970 --> 0:19:4.270
Rajasekaran N
So we will as we grow then definitely we can enhance our IT tools.
0:19:4.280 --> 0:19:5.630
Rajasekaran N
So can I set so with that?
0:19:5.640 --> 0:19:6.510
Rajasekaran N
I'll stop now.
0:19:6.580 --> 0:19:10.790
Rajasekaran N
So my only point is, let us make existing tools robust.
0:19:10.980 --> 0:19:15.530
Rajasekaran N
Then second thing, let us bring at least one or two, two, one or two important tools.
0:19:15.540 --> 0:19:18.950
Rajasekaran N
Which industry is ahead of us to catch catch up with them?
0:19:19.410 --> 0:19:19.920
Umesh Sonawane
So OK.
0:19:19.140 --> 0:19:22.440
Rajasekaran N
We will introduce them this year that is taken in the cable.
0:19:22.520 --> 0:19:27.550
Rajasekaran N
We will align so my request is I should not steal the show, so it's a team work always.
0:19:27.560 --> 0:19:33.620
Rajasekaran N
So my request to Santosh Mangesh Bai and Dilkhush to contribute from your side what all your priorities?
0:19:33.970 --> 0:19:36.260
Rajasekaran N
What support you need from IT?
0:19:36.500 --> 0:19:37.690
Rajasekaran N
OK, now Mangesh right.
0:19:38.40 --> 0:19:38.220
Umesh Sonawane
That's.
0:19:37.700 --> 0:19:38.350
Rajasekaran N
You would like to start.
0:19:38.350 --> 0:19:38.940
Umesh Sonawane
Thank you.
0:19:39.50 --> 0:19:40.460
Umesh Sonawane
Thank you. Yeah.
0:19:40.540 --> 0:19:40.680
Rajasekaran N
Yeah.
0:19:47.590 --> 0:19:47.950
Rajasekaran N
Ah.
0:19:42.640 --> 0:19:50.130
Umesh Sonawane
So right now one more tool that we are using that is Atul Mitra that maybe Rajas have this to add.
0:19:50.370 --> 0:19:50.830
Rajasekaran N
Yes, yes.
0:19:50.320 --> 0:20:4.710
Umesh Sonawane
So I think that is the liquidation to this, whatever we have produced and given to the Parmar, whether to the distributor, whether that material has been liquidated by Parmar or not, whether that material has been consumed by farmer or not.
0:20:4.970 --> 0:20:7.100
Umesh Sonawane
That will be tracked through that too, so.
0:20:10.30 --> 0:20:10.210
Umesh Sonawane
But.
0:20:11.920 --> 0:20:12.930
Umesh Sonawane
Are they aligned?
0:20:13.280 --> 0:20:14.990
Umesh Sonawane
Do you get that information back?
0:20:15.0 --> 0:20:27.90
Umesh Sonawane
Yes, yes, we are getting the information, but there are these tools have fully implemented means the facility that we have whatever we are producing in Atul, we are able to capture that information.
0:20:27.200 --> 0:20:37.390
Umesh Sonawane
But whatever we are producing at third party P2P or outside of Atul for the those products, we do not have this facility available.
0:20:37.820 --> 0:20:39.600
Umesh Sonawane
So that has to be extended.
0:20:39.940 --> 0:20:48.290
Umesh Sonawane
Atul Mitra facility has to be extended so that we have taken as a KIKO for the year 2020, four, 25.
0:20:48.400 --> 0:20:53.540
Umesh Sonawane
But that is available in Oracle whatever third party produce that data we are have it is available in or.
0:20:54.580 --> 0:21:0.770
Umesh Sonawane
So whenever we take inward material, invert that automatically, that material will yeah be captured in four.
0:21:1.50 --> 0:21:2.280
Umesh Sonawane
Please, please continue.
0:21:2.600 --> 0:21:6.50
Umesh Sonawane
This is 1 app plan for regarding a plan we search.
0:21:6.480 --> 0:21:8.370
Umesh Sonawane
We have made some.
0:21:7.240 --> 0:21:9.10
Rajasekaran N
Amongst I guess.
0:21:12.60 --> 0:21:13.50
Rajasekaran N
Who in Atul Mitra?
0:21:12.190 --> 0:21:13.370
Umesh Sonawane
Said you are not audible.
0:21:15.60 --> 0:21:16.690
Umesh Sonawane
Uh, there we can hear you now.
0:21:17.530 --> 0:21:18.410
Rajasekaran N
Ohh is it better?
0:21:19.740 --> 0:21:19.900
Umesh Sonawane
Yes.
0:21:21.700 --> 0:21:36.780
Rajasekaran N
So in Atul, mitral, also now under that, I'm not sure whether that will be part of IT because they used to say Sir, once that label they take out from the box, they say Sir it is not getting scanned, is it a QR code printing problem or it's more of a IT not capturing the data.
0:21:38.420 --> 0:21:41.0
Umesh Sonawane
But it is a it said should be identified.
0:21:41.500 --> 0:21:44.940
Umesh Sonawane
We are not sure whether it is IT issue or it is a QR code issue.
0:21:48.940 --> 0:21:49.70
Umesh Sonawane
Yes.
0:21:46.200 --> 0:21:53.260
Rajasekaran N
OK, so this one small pain point where we are putting all the boxes once they take out their above supposed to scan that to get the credit.
0:21:53.530 --> 0:21:55.180
Rajasekaran N
But that is not picking up.
0:21:55.190 --> 0:21:57.70
Rajasekaran N
Then again, they have to call IT so.
0:21:56.370 --> 0:21:57.870
Umesh Sonawane
It's yes.
0:21:58.50 --> 0:22:0.20
Rajasekaran N
OK, this is Atul, Mitra.
0:22:0.130 --> 0:22:0.880
Rajasekaran N
So I missed that.
0:22:0.890 --> 0:22:1.690
Rajasekaran N
Thanks Mangesh, right?
0:22:2.470 --> 0:22:3.80
Umesh Sonawane
Yeah.
0:22:3.430 --> 0:22:3.770
Rajasekaran N
Wait.
0:22:3.550 --> 0:22:5.580
Umesh Sonawane
Second point is regarding plan.
0:22:5.590 --> 0:22:9.220
Umesh Sonawane
We search, we have made some customization in plan research.
0:22:9.710 --> 0:22:14.760
Umesh Sonawane
There are five different screens which is not a standard product, correct?
0:22:14.770 --> 0:22:26.680
Umesh Sonawane
So we have designed five different screens and it has now almost 9899.9% of the issues have been resolved and we have started implementing it from this month onwards.
0:22:27.590 --> 0:22:32.360
Umesh Sonawane
We have yesterday we had one around of discussion with one region.
0:22:32.670 --> 0:22:34.710
Umesh Sonawane
They are going to to the entries.
0:22:35.270 --> 0:22:36.850
Umesh Sonawane
Uh, but it?
0:22:36.940 --> 0:22:39.970
Umesh Sonawane
Same with complete zone will be completed by 4.
0:22:40.320 --> 0:22:43.590
Umesh Sonawane
So one zone we were, we are going to complete, we have 3 zones out of that.
0:22:43.600 --> 0:22:47.140
Umesh Sonawane
One zone will be completed by 4th of this month.
0:22:47.150 --> 0:22:47.630
Umesh Sonawane
Very good.
0:22:47.680 --> 0:22:49.700
Umesh Sonawane
Yeah, this is the update.
0:22:49.990 --> 0:23:1.50
Umesh Sonawane
As soon as we do a successful implementation or successful data entry in the tool, we will go ahead for All India from next month onwards.
0:23:1.60 --> 0:23:6.570
Umesh Sonawane
The target date for implementation is June 8th, so that is what the target date.
0:23:6.580 --> 0:23:14.420
Umesh Sonawane
We, myself and Umesh that have agreed and we are working on it, so that is the update on the plan we set.
0:23:14.510 --> 0:23:19.740
Umesh Sonawane
It is only only on sales for trusting or it is only of sales force for trusting yes.
0:23:19.750 --> 0:23:24.360
Umesh Sonawane
But what they have done is, as Mangesh was narrating, they have done a lot of customization there.
0:23:24.410 --> 0:23:26.960
Umesh Sonawane
So in fact, they're uploading distributor stocks also.
0:23:27.280 --> 0:23:27.760
Umesh Sonawane
Yes, Sir.
0:23:28.10 --> 0:23:28.200
Umesh Sonawane
Yes.
0:23:28.210 --> 0:23:37.380
Umesh Sonawane
So it is sales for like you know it appears sales focusing only but there are a lot of customization and thoughts are given behind that customization.
0:24:8.820 --> 0:24:9.0
Rajasekaran N
Good.
0:23:38.160 --> 0:24:11.120
Umesh Sonawane
So going forward, whatever the Atul Mika that I'm talking about, then that Atul Mitra has to be linked with plan research means liquidation data to be captured, liquidation data history to be captured from Atul Mitra to planning same way channel inventory also we are getting through that also will be should be captured through plans that so this is a longer way ahead but we have to start that second a planning side I have yes Sir.
0:24:12.440 --> 0:24:14.260
Rajasekaran N
That is, that is the beauty.
0:24:14.780 --> 0:24:15.410
Rajasekaran N
That is what?
0:24:15.460 --> 0:24:15.640
Rajasekaran N
No.
0:24:15.650 --> 0:24:22.520
Rajasekaran N
We customized the of land reside so that tomorrow ohh both both are in same Oracle platform.
0:24:22.590 --> 0:24:30.250
Rajasekaran N
So that once the secondary, once the retailer opened the box and send sell it to format then it should get recorded in automate.
0:24:31.410 --> 0:24:31.550
Umesh Sonawane
Yes.
0:24:34.590 --> 0:24:36.770
Umesh Sonawane
It's perfect.
0:24:36.780 --> 0:24:38.490
Umesh Sonawane
Perfect. Yes.
0:24:30.780 --> 0:24:49.210
Rajasekaran N
Then if it speaks main distributed which isn't plan, then our cycle is and I don't think any company they have that kind of a mapping which Mangesh Bai said that you know vision to connect the retailer Palmer retailer and the distributor through these two apps.
0:24:49.300 --> 0:24:50.310
Rajasekaran N
They can speak each other.
0:24:50.540 --> 0:24:52.70
Rajasekaran N
That is where the customization done.
0:24:53.50 --> 0:24:53.210
Umesh Sonawane
That.
0:25:1.410 --> 0:25:1.610
Umesh Sonawane
You.
0:24:52.250 --> 0:25:12.600
Rajasekaran N
If a client vanilla you know launched long bag but it was not of use because we could not get the customer inventory proper and also whether the being capacity not maybe we Retail would have launched the vanilla product, but we have customized these two angle customer inventory also customer payment be also so that we can forecast it properly.
0:25:12.930 --> 0:25:13.480
Rajasekaran N
OK, Sir.
0:25:14.670 --> 0:25:15.70
Umesh Sonawane
Yeah.
0:25:13.910 --> 0:25:16.750
Rajasekaran N
So maybe you can look at it other ones.
0:25:15.80 --> 0:25:18.700
Umesh Sonawane
So yeah, and Lal shikanji.
0:25:18.710 --> 0:25:24.350
Umesh Sonawane
Now the the downward leg is to connect with the plant for MRP execution.
0:25:25.360 --> 0:25:25.840

Ohh.
0:25:25.200 --> 0:25:32.730
Umesh Sonawane
So that is there is there in in the mind or you would like to hold from that want to get into the production planning also.
0:25:32.920 --> 0:25:35.670
Umesh Sonawane
But we have limitations up to demand planning.
0:25:35.680 --> 0:25:36.770
Umesh Sonawane
That is what the no, no.
0:25:36.780 --> 0:26:7.780
Umesh Sonawane
That we'll have to invest a little bit because we don't have that licenses for CP retail retail business is basically so let me let us let me put that also in one of our chaos also it was told that when we take a customer order today, we are not able to give them a delivery date, correct, OK, so this is this is all what we are trying to do your sales forecasting then this MRP and the production scheduling, all those things would be linked together to enable you this, yes, OK.
0:26:7.850 --> 0:26:18.880
Umesh Sonawane
And we we really want to, I mean I do not know whether would be able to finish this production scheduling for all these business, but definitely would do for 2/3 businesses.
0:26:19.210 --> 0:26:53.710
Umesh Sonawane
OK, so that this all at least raw material planning MRP planning we can think of because we have involved Ganesh for CP bulk and similarly for CP Retail also we can think of Raw Patel planning MRP planning and for the scheduling as serve mentioned we will try to see if we can accommodate CP otherwise we are target 2-3 different businesses and CP will CP Retail will come in subsequent but yeah let me yeah no problem Ohol on this point only there are three steps for retail business one is better one is demand planning production plan this.
0:26:54.260 --> 0:27:4.10
Umesh Sonawane
Whatever the demand that is coming in planning so that we are capturing and there is another point that you have said about the production scheduling and MRP, MRP.
0:27:4.280 --> 0:27:10.430
Umesh Sonawane
So in between there is one more layer is there in retail business that is we are having multiple depots.
0:27:10.520 --> 0:27:30.160
Umesh Sonawane
There are 22 depots we have and we have to keep on replenishing the data, replenishing the material so these these activity should be also should be taken care, otherwise we will miss this in between layers and maybe there are errors they will get so.
