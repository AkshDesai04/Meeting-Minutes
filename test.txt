0:0:0.0 --> 0:0:0.250
Rajasekaran N
Hmm.
0:0:4.90 --> 0:0:4.980
Umesh Sonawane
How we can give you the intelligence to you to make some decisions in terms of if it is a visualization, transports, et cetera.
0:0:8.840 --> 0:0:9.20
Rajasekaran N
So.
0:0:5.800 --> 0:0:12.850
Umesh Sonawane
So I would request you think through this everyone from your team will you can take five, five minutes and you just list down.
0:0:13.40 --> 0:0:14.550
Umesh Sonawane
These are the things we want to do.
0:0:15.410 --> 0:0:15.590
Rajasekaran N
So.
0:0:14.940 --> 0:0:20.70
Umesh Sonawane
Probably later on we will sort, we will understand the priorities and etcetera.
0:0:20.160 --> 0:0:21.200
Umesh Sonawane
But let's start with this.
0:0:21.960 --> 0:0:22.380
Rajasekaran N
Sure, sure.
0:0:23.530 --> 0:0:23.810
Umesh Sonawane
OK.
0:0:23.450 --> 0:0:26.490
Rajasekaran N
But first of all, umm, thanks for that dinner.
0:0:26.500 --> 0:0:37.820
Rajasekaran N
I'll kick off the data and this itself shows how IT can be a good enabler for businesses because the first time we were always begined IT but first time.
0:0:38.320 --> 0:0:40.320
Rajasekaran N
Maybe it's a good coincidence data also, right?
0:1:13.890 --> 0:1:14.70
Umesh Sonawane
Better.
0:0:43.700 --> 0:1:19.900
Rajasekaran N
Missed by trying to dismiss use and realities, so this again reinforces every but now and then you know S are always say that they are always saying we should be one of the leading company in the IT space on the we probably say compared to other chemical company we have our own it like that we used to say and many products what we have given to the market also very well received and we will by knows Atul Setu is 1 because Dilkhush people but by everybody was helping us that one man I think Manisha man everybody.
0:1:20.10 --> 0:1:25.300
Rajasekaran N
Was that and it is a very innocuous the yeah not tool.
0:1:25.670 --> 0:1:29.650
Rajasekaran N
And one of the envying to the industry and people take as an example.
0:1:32.350 --> 0:1:35.310
Rajasekaran N
Ohh, I'd complete the meeting this.
0:1:37.390 --> 0:1:39.370
Rajasekaran N
You same same.
0:1:41.230 --> 0:1:46.240
Rajasekaran N
So umm that like that one tool has come now very good.
0:1:46.310 --> 0:1:53.720
Rajasekaran N
So and the other one is a honeycomb that is also I think you know it knows developed and for the MDO management.
0:1:54.430 --> 0:1:55.780
Rajasekaran N
So that is going fine.
0:1:55.830 --> 0:1:57.20
Rajasekaran N
Little bit of fine tuning.
0:1:57.30 --> 0:1:59.40
Rajasekaran N
You know, we need to make welcome again, right.
0:2:0.210 --> 0:2:0.500
Umesh Sonawane
The.
0:1:59.610 --> 0:2:6.290
Rajasekaran N
And when I talked about plan visits and Mangesh by arrived, when you think of a Devil, devil has come.
0:2:5.390 --> 0:2:7.80
Umesh Sonawane
Of put them in.
0:2:7.630 --> 0:2:9.110
Rajasekaran N
Don't get the Angel.
0:2:9.630 --> 0:2:11.300
Rajasekaran N
Devil is not the right example.
0:2:12.70 --> 0:2:12.330
Umesh Sonawane
Derek.
0:2:11.370 --> 0:2:12.930
Rajasekaran N
OK, so the one.
0:2:15.330 --> 0:2:18.0
Rajasekaran N
One thing work in progress is planned size.
0:2:18.330 --> 0:2:20.280
Rajasekaran N
So with Mangesh, why is the right person?
0:2:20.620 --> 0:2:55.490
Rajasekaran N
He was leading that activity, demand planning tool, but though that is not announced but definitely you know it was a collaborative, I don't know ID: one which was long waited and I understand people Retail successfully implemented and started using and we had some tips Mangesh by we talk about that on plan research what is the expectation so Mangesh by what I was saying this is a good initiative that IT team is coming proactively and asking businesses hey how I can be enabled for you and how I can make your business you know further profitable and group.
0:2:55.640 --> 0:2:56.230
Rajasekaran N
Speeding growth.
0:2:56.340 --> 0:3:5.290
Rajasekaran N
So that's what I was very happy for them and of course till that time also whenever we were going behind, of course Dilkhush can vouch for it because.
0:3:7.90 --> 0:3:9.540
Rajasekaran N
Our business is no timely.
0:3:9.550 --> 0:3:16.280
Rajasekaran N
You know, we need to respond back because we are handling farmers, you know, crop on disk, cannot wait for our IT team or whatever.
0:3:16.470 --> 0:3:23.680
Rajasekaran N
So whenever any new term or anything any no in the IT GST is not picking up.
0:3:23.690 --> 0:3:33.870
Rajasekaran N
So always they could, you know, moves to the IT office and we we used to get a very good response time from IT team despite their workload and priorities distance.
0:3:32.440 --> 0:3:35.140
Umesh Sonawane
As a as a it did OK.
0:3:35.950 --> 0:3:36.580
Rajasekaran N
So thanks for that.
