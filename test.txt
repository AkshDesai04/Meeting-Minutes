0:0:0.0 --> 0:0:0.250
Rajasekaran N
Hmm.
0:0:4.90 --> 0:0:4.980
Umesh Sonawane
How we can give you the intelligence to you to make some decisions in terms of if it is a visualization, transports, et cetera.
0:0:8.840 --> 0:0:9.20
Rajasekaran N
So.
0:0:5.800 --> 0:0:12.850
Umesh Sonawane
So I would request you think through this everyone from your team will you can take five, five minutes and you just list down.
0:0:13.40 --> 0:0:14.550
Umesh Sonawane
These are the things we want to do.
0:0:15.410 --> 0:0:15.590
Rajasekaran N
So.
0:0:14.940 --> 0:0:20.70
Umesh Sonawane
Probably later on we will sort, we will understand the priorities and etcetera.
0:0:20.160 --> 0:0:21.200
Umesh Sonawane
But let's start with this.
0:0:21.960 --> 0:0:22.380
Rajasekaran N
Sure, sure.
0:0:23.530 --> 0:0:23.810
Umesh Sonawane
OK.
0:0:23.450 --> 0:0:26.490
Rajasekaran N
But first of all, umm, thanks for that dinner.
0:0:26.500 --> 0:0:37.820
Rajasekaran N
I'll kick off the data and this itself shows how IT can be a good enabler for businesses because the first time we were always begined IT but first time.
0:0:38.320 --> 0:0:40.320
Rajasekaran N
Maybe it's a good coincidence data also, right?
0:1:13.890 --> 0:1:14.70
Umesh Sonawane
Better.
0:0:43.700 --> 0:1:19.900
Rajasekaran N
Missed by trying to dismiss use and realities, so this again reinforces every but now and then you know S are always say that they are always saying we should be one of the leading company in the IT space on the we probably say compared to other chemical company we have our own it like that we used to say and many products what we have given to the market also very well received and we will by knows Atul Setu is 1 because Dilkhush people but by everybody was helping us that one man I think Manisha man everybody.
0:1:20.10 --> 0:1:25.300
Rajasekaran N
Was that and it is a very innocuous the yeah not tool.
0:1:25.670 --> 0:1:29.650
Rajasekaran N
And one of the envying to the industry and people take as an example.
0:1:32.350 --> 0:1:35.310
Rajasekaran N
Ohh, I'd complete the meeting this.
0:1:37.390 --> 0:1:39.370
Rajasekaran N
You same same.
0:1:41.230 --> 0:1:46.240
Rajasekaran N
So umm that like that one tool has come now very good.
0:1:46.310 --> 0:1:53.720
Rajasekaran N
So and the other one is a honeycomb that is also I think you know it knows developed and for the MDO management.
0:1:54.430 --> 0:1:55.780
Rajasekaran N
So that is going fine.
0:1:55.830 --> 0:1:57.20
Rajasekaran N
Little bit of fine tuning.
0:1:57.30 --> 0:1:59.40
Rajasekaran N
You know, we need to make welcome again, right.
0:2:0.210 --> 0:2:0.500
Umesh Sonawane
The.
0:1:59.610 --> 0:2:6.290
Rajasekaran N
And when I talked about plan visits and Mangesh by arrived, when you think of a Devil, devil has come.
0:2:5.390 --> 0:2:7.80
Umesh Sonawane
Of put them in.
0:2:7.630 --> 0:2:9.110
Rajasekaran N
Don't get the Angel.
0:2:9.630 --> 0:2:11.300
Rajasekaran N
Devil is not the right example.
0:2:12.70 --> 0:2:12.330
Umesh Sonawane
Derek.
0:2:11.370 --> 0:2:12.930
Rajasekaran N
OK, so the one.
0:2:15.330 --> 0:2:18.0
Rajasekaran N
One thing work in progress is planned size.
0:2:18.330 --> 0:2:20.280
Rajasekaran N
So with Mangesh, why is the right person?
0:2:20.620 --> 0:2:55.490
Rajasekaran N
He was leading that activity, demand planning tool, but though that is not announced but definitely you know it was a collaborative, I don't know ID: one which was long waited and I understand people Retail successfully implemented and started using and we had some tips Mangesh by we talk about that on plan research what is the expectation so Mangesh by what I was saying this is a good initiative that IT team is coming proactively and asking businesses hey how I can be enabled for you and how I can make your business you know further profitable and group.
0:2:55.640 --> 0:2:56.230
Rajasekaran N
Speeding growth.
0:2:56.340 --> 0:3:5.290
Rajasekaran N
So that's what I was very happy for them and of course till that time also whenever we were going behind, of course Dilkhush can vouch for it because.
0:3:7.90 --> 0:3:9.540
Rajasekaran N
Our business is no timely.
0:3:9.550 --> 0:3:16.280
Rajasekaran N
You know, we need to respond back because we are handling farmers, you know, crop on disk, cannot wait for our IT team or whatever.
0:3:16.470 --> 0:3:23.680
Rajasekaran N
So whenever any new term or anything any no in the IT GST is not picking up.
0:3:23.690 --> 0:3:33.870
Rajasekaran N
So always they could, you know, moves to the IT office and we we used to get a very good response time from IT team despite their workload and priorities distance.
0:3:32.440 --> 0:3:35.140
Umesh Sonawane
As a as a it did OK.
0:3:35.950 --> 0:3:36.580
Rajasekaran N
So thanks for that.
0:3:38.690 --> 0:3:40.600
Umesh Sonawane
Thank you it.
0:3:38.430 --> 0:3:42.440
Rajasekaran N
OK, so thanks for coming from there.
0:3:44.360 --> 0:3:44.640
Umesh Sonawane
But.
0:3:42.690 --> 0:3:48.800
Rajasekaran N
Business site Umeshbhai was asking how was the journey so conceding Lee they closed the.
0:3:46.700 --> 0:3:50.230
Umesh Sonawane
Yep, you can tell one Patel. But.
0:3:52.220 --> 0:3:53.370
Umesh Sonawane
Focus, focus, focus.
0:3:54.500 --> 0:3:54.830
Umesh Sonawane
That's not.
0:3:57.430 --> 0:3:57.730
Umesh Sonawane
OK.
0:3:59.680 --> 0:4:0.230
Umesh Sonawane
Uh, yes.
0:3:59.390 --> 0:4:2.680
Rajasekaran N
And this so the queen savingly.
0:4:3.510 --> 0:4:16.180
Rajasekaran N
It was a good no news that you would have seen enough in the mails that first time CP retail maybe after, you know recent gap then we are making maybe the positive close to five crore.
0:4:16.490 --> 0:4:18.740
Rajasekaran N
What I understand here last year was minus 8 crore.
0:4:19.800 --> 0:4:20.70
Umesh Sonawane
No.
0:4:20.80 --> 0:4:20.780
Umesh Sonawane
Good, good, very good.
0:4:19.290 --> 0:4:22.250
Rajasekaran N
So when when we took over as thanks for that.
0:4:22.260 --> 0:4:22.610
Rajasekaran N
Yeah.
0:4:22.690 --> 0:4:23.270
Rajasekaran N
Thanks for that.
0:4:23.580 --> 0:4:36.630
Rajasekaran N
When we started our journey of Naya Abdul in CP Retail, we had a terminology of Maya Atul from 2019 onwards because earlier we were not having a directionally uh growth, no direction.
0:4:36.640 --> 0:4:37.410
Rajasekaran N
We were not having.
0:4:37.420 --> 0:4:40.180
Rajasekaran N
It was always absent down since it's inception.
0:4:40.990 --> 0:4:44.620
Rajasekaran N
Maybe Dilkhush can mention it is around 2014 or so.
0:4:45.70 --> 0:4:50.20
Rajasekaran N
We started over now journey, but it was always ups and down ranging from 80 to 120 crore.
0:4:50.590 --> 0:4:54.160
Rajasekaran N
But now in 918 nineteen it was around 88 crore.
0:4:54.220 --> 0:4:56.940
Rajasekaran N
Now we have crossed 200 crore every year.
0:4:56.950 --> 0:5:3.250
Rajasekaran N
We were on a growth path and a profitably also this year onwards we will be making profit this year means last financial year.
0:5:4.10 --> 0:5:8.280
Rajasekaran N
So over and also we got our own patented product called Sindica.
0:5:8.560 --> 0:5:15.980
Rajasekaran N
Till that time we were using only our manufacturing that chemistry strength of participating in the generic product which others also ask.
0:5:15.990 --> 0:5:22.530
Rajasekaran N
There was no specialization, but for our chemistry of, you know, manufacturing sites or whatever.
0:5:23.470 --> 0:5:26.540
Rajasekaran N
But now we'll be having our unique patented product marketing team.
0:5:26.550 --> 0:5:28.120
Rajasekaran N
Province are also you guys will be meeting.
0:5:28.650 --> 0:5:39.880
Rajasekaran N
So he's a grip, you know, on a constant space, he's bringing new active ingredients and the specialized product so that we can be taken as a serious player in the Indian market, OK and.
0:5:39.620 --> 0:5:39.890
Umesh Sonawane
How?
0:5:39.900 --> 0:5:40.890
Umesh Sonawane
How is it patents?
0:5:40.900 --> 0:5:41.300
Umesh Sonawane
Do you have?
0:5:42.480 --> 0:5:43.790
Umesh Sonawane
Of just one picture.
0:5:42.750 --> 0:5:45.620
Rajasekaran N
So maybe 3-4?
0:5:47.480 --> 0:5:47.720
Umesh Sonawane
OK.
0:5:45.730 --> 0:5:53.100
Rajasekaran N
Maybe maybe having maybe province or will give you exact number, but the 3-4 product but only one product so far is launched last year they called sindica.
0:5:53.450 --> 0:5:55.100
Rajasekaran N
That is the first patented product.
0:5:55.310 --> 0:5:57.960
Rajasekaran N
No, we just come to the market and it is accepted very well.
0:5:58.450 --> 0:6:25.820
Rajasekaran N
So that is also one of the boost that you know, despite last year was a very bad year because of the external factors and our business is you will see multiple times will talk about Bhagwan in our business, other business may not talk too much of God but here suddenly rain came server game OK I am based is not come back one did not send a note timely you know whether is needed for the disease to set in or insect to come.
